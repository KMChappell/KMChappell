### Hi I'm Kaitlyn

- Location: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States
- Current Role: Integrated Solutions Engineer @ Halon
- Pronouns: They/Them

I am a neurodiverse, disabled, queer software engineer that loves making goofy projects and experimenting with new things. I'm primarily a backend developer, but I know enough frontend to be dangerous! I'm currently learning Rails, but my background is in Python and Java. I'm proficient in Docker and Kubernetes and I'm working toward a Certified Kubernetes Administrator certification. I also have a love of Rust and would love to work with it full time in the future. Other software related interests include data science, machine learning, and devops.

My non-software hobbies include sewing, baking, birdwatching, and playing with my cat, Guppy! I also garden and someday would like to have a small, sustainable farm.
