### Hi I'm Kaitlyn

- Location: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States
- Current Role: Integrated Solutions Engineer @ Halon
- Pronouns: They/Them

I am a neurodiverse, disabled, queer software engineer that loves making goofy projects and experimenting with new things. I'm primarily a backend developer, but I know enough frontend to be dangerous! My background is Ruby, Python, and Java, but I've dabbled a bit in Rust and C++ as well. I have a passion for DevOps and infrastructure, security, and automating everything.

My non-software hobbies include baking, birdwatching, and playing with my cat, Guppy!
